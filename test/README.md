## To test mapping simulated SMURF-seq reads to a small simulated genome
A simulated reference genome `ref_sim.fa` has been indexed with BWA-MEM.
`read_sim.fastq` contains simulated reads.

## To test mapping simulated reads to the human genome
`read_hg.fastq` contains simulated reads from the human genome.
